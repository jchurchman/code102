  cd <Directory> - go to <Directory>
  ls - List files in current Directory

Git workflow:
  Git Status - Current Status
  Git add <FILENAME> - add file to qeue
  Git commit -m "COMMENT ON FILE"
  git add -p -patches file instead of git commit
  git checkout -b <BRANCH NAME> - makes a branch repo

Homework:
